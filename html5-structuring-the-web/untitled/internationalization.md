## How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?

The question is a little vague, I will assume that it is asking about the most common case, which is how to serve a page with content available in multiple languages, but the content within the page should be displayed only in one consistent language.

When an HTTP request is made to a server, the requesting user agent usually sends information about language preferences, such as in the `Accept-Language` header. The server can then use this information to return a version of the document in the appropriate language if such an alternative is available. The returned HTML document should also declare the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag, such as `<html lang="en">...</html>`.

In the back end, the HTML markup will contain `i18n` placeholders and content for the specific language stored in YML or JSON formats. The server then dynamically generates the HTML page with content in that particular language, usually with the help of a back end framework.
